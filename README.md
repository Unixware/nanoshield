**WTH is this...**

Shield/dock/whatever for [MiSTeryNano](https://github.com/harbaum/MiSTeryNano) project (nano tang 20k + M0S dock)  
Ports on this is just **MIDI-out** and **Joystick** only (no level shifters for mice)  
Resistors R1/R2 may need different values
100% THT so low cost to produce  

**WARNING**

YMMV _check_ before use, proceed with caution etc etc as I may have messed/missed something there...

**Thanks**

To [Till](https://github.com/harbaum/) for patiently answering my tech questions!

**notes**

If you use midi
R1/R2 100ohm
C1    100nF

11/12/2025 Updated with fabrication files for [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)
           nanoshield.zip as gerber file
           bom.csv as BOM
           positions.csv as CPL files (all of them into 'production' folder)
           also note headers not visible on JLC's site - not big deal IMHO
